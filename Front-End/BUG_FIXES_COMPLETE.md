# Subscription System Bug Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Scan Count Display Error
**Problem**: After first scan, showing "1 scan left" instead of "2 scans left"

**Root Cause**: The subscription display wasn't being updated after successful scans, and there was a potential race condition between scan completion and page redirect.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `updateSubscriptionDisplay()` function to update the UI after successful scans
- Modified `recordScanResults()` to update the subscription display with the latest count
- Added proper error handling to prevent redirects if scan recording fails
- Fixed the timing issue by waiting for scan recording to complete before redirecting

### 2. ✅ Username Display Error  
**Problem**: Showing "root" instead of actual username in top-right corner

**Root Cause**: The session username was being corrupted or overwritten with database connection username.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added username validation in `main_page.php`
- If session username is "root" or empty, fetch the correct username from database
- Update the session with the correct username to prevent future issues

## Files Modified

### `main_page.php`
1. **Added username fix**: Fetches correct username from database if session shows "root"
2. **Added `updateSubscriptionDisplay()` function**: Updates scan count in real-time
3. **Enhanced `recordScanResults()` function**: Now updates UI and handles errors better
4. **Improved scan flow**: Waits for scan recording before redirecting to results

### Debug Files Created
1. **`debug_scan_count.php`**: Test scan counting logic step-by-step
2. **`debug_session.php`**: Check session data and username issues

## Testing Instructions

### Test Scan Count Fix:
1. Log in as a free user
2. Note initial scan count (should show "3 scans remaining")
3. Perform a URL or file scan
4. ✅ Should now show "2 scans remaining" (not "1 scan remaining")
5. Perform another scan 
6. ✅ Should show "1 scan remaining"
7. Perform third scan
8. ✅ Should show "0 scans remaining" with upgrade prompt

### Test Username Fix:
1. Log out completely
2. Log in with your actual username (not "root")
3. ✅ Top-right corner should show your actual username
4. If it still shows "root", run `debug_session.php` to see what's happening

### Debug Tools:
- Visit `http://localhost/grad/debug_scan_count.php` - Test scan counting logic
- Visit `http://localhost/grad/debug_session.php` - Check session and username data
- Visit `http://localhost/grad/test_subscription.php` - Full subscription system test

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Scan Count Flow:
```
User Login: "3 scans remaining today"
After 1st scan: "2 scans remaining today" ✅
After 2nd scan: "1 scan remaining today" ✅  
After 3rd scan: "0 scans remaining today" + upgrade button ✅
```

### Username Display:
```
Login with username "john123" → Top right shows "john123" ✅
Login with username "alice" → Top right shows "alice" ✅
Never shows "root" unless that's the actual username ✅
```

## Technical Details

### Scan Count Fix:
- The issue was that UI updates happened after page redirects
- Now the scan recording completes first, updates the UI, then redirects
- Added proper error handling for scan limit scenarios
- Real-time subscription display updates using JavaScript

### Username Fix:
- Added database lookup to verify/correct session username
- Prevents "root" from being displayed due to MySQL connection issues
- Session is updated with correct username for future page loads

## Verification

Run these commands to verify the fixes:

1. **Check scan counting**:
   ```
   Visit: debug_scan_count.php
   Expected: Proper progression from 3→2→1→0 scans
   ```

2. **Check username display**:
   ```
   Visit: debug_session.php  
   Expected: Session username matches database username
   ```

3. **End-to-end test**:
   ```
   Visit: main_page.php
   Expected: Correct username in top-right, proper scan counting
   ```

The subscription system should now work perfectly with accurate scan counting and proper username display!

You are a malware analyst. Analyze the following XML manifest and strictly follow these instructions for your response:

Installer Framework:

Identify the installer framework (for example, "Inno Setup", "NSIS", "InstallShield", etc.).
After the framework name, write either "-> Legitimate" if it is a well-known, widely used, and trusted installer framework, or "-> Non-Legitimate" if it is unknown, suspicious, or custom.
Requested Privileges:

Check the requested execution level in the XML.
If the XML requests administrator privileges (for example, <requestedExecutionLevel level="requireAdministrator" .../>), write:
privileges -> Request Administration
If it does not request administrator privileges, write:
privileges -> Does Not Require Administration
Do not add any greetings, summaries, or extra explanations. Only output the framework and privilege information in the specified format.

Example Output:
Installer Framework: Inno Setup -> Legitimate
privileges -> Request Administration

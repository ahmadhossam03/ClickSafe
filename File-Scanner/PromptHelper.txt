
=== MALWARE STRING CLASSIFICATION RULES ===

Categories:
- Normal: No indication of threat.
- Suspicious: May indicate malicious behavior depending on context.
- Malicious: Commonly used in malware for known malicious behavior.

Default rule:
If no malicious or suspicious pattern is matched, classify as "Normal".

Always use this format:
<string> -> <Normal/Suspicious/Malicious> : <Short explanation if suspicious/malicious>
